## Character Actions & Reasoning

### CHARACTER: Aragorn
**ACTION:** The bustling Prancing Pony Inn hummed with the lively chatter of travelers and adventurers. Aragorn, his keen eyes scanning the room, caught sight of Frodo Baggins sitting quietly at a corner table, nursing a mug of ale. Gandalf the Grey stood by the fireplace, deep in conversation with Barliman Butterbur.
**REASONING:** Aragorn, driven by his loyalty to Frodo and his duty as a Ranger, is observing the surroundings for potential threats while also ensuring that Gandalf remains undisturbed in his conversation with Barliman Butterbur, who could be vital in providing information about recent events involving the Ring.

**Consistency Check:** Action consistent with cunning/subtle approach
**Development Notes:** This scene presents an opportunity for Aragorn to deepen his protective instincts and sense of duty towards Frodo, recognizing the hobbit's pivotal role in the quest against Sauron. It also advances their story by positioning Aragorn as a guardian figure who can offer guidance and support to Frodo amidst the dangers lurking in Bree.

Gandalf the Grey stood by the fireplace, deep in conversation with Barliman Butterbur.

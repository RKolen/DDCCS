## Prancing Pony Warning

The bustling Prancing Pony Inn hummed with the lively chatter of travelers and
adventurers. Aragorn, his keen eyes scanning the room, caught sight of Frodo
Baggins sitting quietly at a corner table, nursing a mug of ale. Gandalf the
Grey stood by the fireplace, deep in conversation with Barliman Butterbur.

Barliman, flustered but earnest, approached Gandalf. "Mister Wizard," he began,
his voice hushed despite the noisy tavern, "there's a matter that needs your
attention. A stranger came by late last night, leaving behind a mysterious
letter for you."

Gandalf’s brow furrowed as he accepted the crumpled parchment. He scanned it
briefly, then looked up at Barliman with a mix of concern and determination.
"Thank you, Barliman," Gandalf said gravely. "We must address this immediately."

Aragorn joined them, his ranger instincts alert to any potential threats. Frodo
followed closely, curiosity piqued by the tension in the air.

Barliman pressed on, fidgeting nervously. “The letter speaks of dark magic
stirring in the nearby ruins of Weathertop,” he explained. “Some say it’s
haunted and cursed.”

Gandalf nodded solemnly. "Ruins of Weathertop indeed harbor ancient evil," he
intoned, glancing at his companions. "It is time to investigate."

Frodo leaned forward, his keen Hobbit senses tingling with unease. "What sort of
dark magic?" he asked tentatively.

“A powerful artifact,” Gandalf replied, his eyes twinkling mysteriously. “One
that could tip the balance in a looming struggle.”

Aragorn’s grip tightened on his bow. "We should set out at once," he said
firmly.

Barliman looked worriedly from one to another. "Be careful out there," he urged.
"Tell me when you return with news of your success."

The party gathered their belongings, ready for the journey ahead. As they
prepared to depart, Frodo turned back to address Barliman with a reassuring
smile. “Thank you for your concern and assistance,” he said warmly.

Together, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo stepped into the twilight, bound by a
shared sense of purpose and anticipation.

## Character Actions & Reasoning

### CHARACTER: Aragorn
**ACTION:** The wind howled around Weathertop as Aragorn, Frodo Baggins, and Gandalf the Grey approached the ancient hill under a blanket of dark clouds. The air was thick with an oppressive energy that made even the most seasoned adventurers
**REASONING:** Aragorn, driven by his loyalty to Frodo and his destiny as the heir of Isildur, presses on towards Weathertop despite the foreboding atmosphere, compelled by a deep sense of duty and the urgent need to protect the Ringbearer from the encroaching forces of darkness.

**Consistency Check:** Action warrants character consistency review
**Development Notes:** This scene presents an opportunity for Aragorn to showcase his leadership and protective instincts as he guards Frodo against the growing darkness and potential threats on Weathertop. It also highlights his internal struggle between his destiny as Isildur's heir and his role as a Ranger, advancing his character development by illustrating his commitment to his companions despite personal risks.

### CHARACTER: Frodo Baggins
**ACTION:** The wind howled around Weathertop as Aragorn, Frodo Baggins, and Gandalf the Grey approached the ancient hill under a blanket of dark clouds. The air was thick with an oppressive energy that made even the most seasoned adventurers
**REASONING:** Character taking action based on current situation

**Consistency Check:** Frodo Baggins, known for his courageous yet often weary demeanor in the face of danger, would likely feel a profound sense of dread and responsibility as they approach Weathertop, despite Aragorn's presence providing some measure of comfort and protection. His established traits include carrying an immense burden that weighs heavily on him, making this scene consistent with his character.
**Development Notes:** The approaching of Weathertop under ominous circumstances presents Frodo with a significant test of his courage and resolve, forcing him to confront the growing burden of carrying the One Ring and the increasing threat it poses. This moment underscores Frodo's journey from an innocent hobbit to a courageous hero willing to face grave danger for the greater good.

### CHARACTER: Gandalf the Grey
**ACTION:** The wind howled around Weathertop as Aragorn, Frodo Baggins, and Gandalf the Grey approached the ancient hill under a blanket of dark clouds. The air was thick with an oppressive energy that made even the most seasoned adventurers
**REASONING:** Gandalf the Grey is likely leading Aragorn and Frodo to Weathertop because it's a strategic location for resting and observing their surroundings, despite the ominous atmosphere. His primary motivation is to protect Frodo from the Ringwraiths while advancing their mission to destroy the One Ring.

**Consistency Check:** This scenario is inconsistent with Gandalf's established traits because Gandalf the Grey does not actually accompany Aragorn and Frodo to Weathertop in the Lord of the Rings tale; it is only Gandalf the White who appears later after his resurrection. Additionally, Gandalf the Grey would have been occupied elsewhere during this part of the story, having fallen in combat with the Witch-king of Angmar.
**Development Notes:** Gandalf's presence at Weathertop amid the oppressive atmosphere presents an opportunity for character development by highlighting his wisdom and resilience in the face of dark magic. This scene also advances his story by showcasing his protective instincts towards Frodo and setting up potential conflicts with the encroaching forces of Sauron.
